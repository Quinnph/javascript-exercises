1. Guessing game:
   
   User is asked to provide a maximum number. The system will then generate a random number on the background (called target number). User is asked to provide maximum 3 guesses in total. Everytime their guess differs from the target number, the system will show them a hint of whether or not their guess is higher or lower than the target number. If their guess matches the target number within 3 attempts, the system will show a message to congrat them and show them the number of attempts they took. 

2. Todo List:

   User has 4 command options as an answer to the question "What would you like to do?": new - list - delete - quit. Enter "new" to add a new item to their todo list. Enter "list" to see their todo list. Enter "delete" to remove an item from the list, provided that the user knows the index of the item in the list. Enter "quit" to quit the app.
