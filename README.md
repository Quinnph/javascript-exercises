1. Guessing game:
   User is asked to provide a maximum number. The system will then generate a random number on the background (called target number). User is asked to provide maximum 3 guesses in total. Everytime their guess differs from the target number, the system will show them a hint of whether or not their guess is higher or lower than the target number. If their guess matches the target number within 3 attempts, the system will show a message to congrat them and show them the number of attempts they took.
